Q1: In 1951, X went on a hunting trip with friends in Ireland. Though he considered himself an excellent shot, X was unable to bag any golden plovers. Trying to give an excuse, X suggested the bird might be the fastest in Europe. Upon returning from the trip, nobody believed him because he was not able to locate a reference book that provided any proof. To settle this debate, X created a book which debuted in 1955 selling more than 120 million copies as of now. What am I talking about?

Q3: X was first sold in pharmacies to assist digestion (though today one might argue the flip side). Later, when the company was officially created, in quite a few years, it was being bottled throughout the States with each bottler using its own label. The company needed a marketing makeover. They did so with a rather basic logo and color scheme. 
Another problem then arose: mistakenly being mixed with the alcohol bottles. That is when they decided to switch to the iconic color scheme - basic yet impactful. The same color would later go on to be used iconically by Dali the 20th century and more recently Andy Warhol. 
What ubiquitous company? What color scheme?

Q4: Nazi U-Boat _ was one of the late-war boats in WW2 fitted with new deepwater high-pressure Xs which allowed them to be used while running at depth. â€˜Disposingâ€™ these facilities was an extremely complicated procedure and special technicians were trained to operate them. Incorrectly opening valves in the wrong sequence could result in waste or seawater flowing back into the hull. However, on 14 April 1945, misuse of the new X caused large amounts of seawater to flood the boat. According to Commander Schlitt's official report, while in the engine room helping to repair one of the diesel engines, he was informed that a malfunction involving the X caused a leak in the forward section. The leak flooded the submarine's batteries (located beneath the X) causing them to generate chlorine gas, leaving him with no alternative but to surface. Once surfaced, U-1206 was discovered and bombed by British patrols, forcing Schlitt to scuttle the submarine. Give X

Q8: X recently took over Y. Since enacting mass layoffs two weeks ago, X has taken to firing employees who have criticised him or his decisions related to Y. Many such employees were high ranking and experienced, leaving insiders even more concerned that Y is at risk of a crash or major failure in functionality, given an already thin and overworked staff. 

Such actions of X lead to him being called by the name of the muppet Z by many employees. It began as a joke, given the close spelling of the Muppet's name to X's own and the irony of his temperamental personality in contrast to that of the kind and curious "Sesame Street" character.
